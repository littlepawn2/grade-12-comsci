Setup
Before each game starts each player will place each of their 5 ships. They need to be placed
vertically or horizontally on the grid space. They cannot be diagonal or hanging off the grid,
the ships can be next to each other but they cannot occupy the same space on the grid. Once the
game has started you cannot move the ships.

Game Play
You and the AI will take turn firing shots. You fire shots by choosing a location on the left grid
If you correctly guess a grid space that is occupied by a ship the text will read hit and a red
marker will be placed on the location you guessed. If you guess incorrectly, the text will read
miss and a white marker will be placed in the location you guessed. Once you have hit every
grid of a ship the text will read “you have sunk a ship”. The first player to sink all 5 ships wins.
